# vanilla-js-banking-frontpage

As the name says it all - This is just a UI project made with HTML and JS only. Features that are pretty much taken for granted with our modern frameworks and libraries are actually a bit cumbersome and all over the place when using no state management and hooks and stuff. The page implements a layover sign-up form, lazy loaded content, page location-based scrolling event, hover event-based CSS manipulation from DOM, and a slider at the bottom.
